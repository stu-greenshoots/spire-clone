### Magazine Review Notes (58/100)
**Date:** 2026-01-24
**Context:** Game Zone preview review — scored us 58/100. PR #11 raised with review.html.

**What I did:**
- Raised PR #11 with review.html (magazine-style feedback document)
- Added PM comments mapping feedback to team owners with effort estimates
- Added priority recommendation for Sprint 3 (ordered by impact-to-effort)
- Brought in mentor for architectural guidance (tooltips, combat feedback, sprite sheets)
- Updated all team diaries with review takeaways
- Created Sprint 3 backlog in SPRINT_BOARD.md with 10 new tasks

**Score breakdown:**
- Gameplay: 7/10 (combat works, faithful to StS)
- Presentation: 6/10 (too dark, no rarity distinction)
- Stability: 4/10 (3 P0 bugs — all being fixed in Sprint 2)
- UX/Polish: 5/10 (no tooltips, no feedback, no previews)

**Sprint 3 path to 70+:**
- Close P0s (Sprint 2) → Stability: 4→7
- Brightness pass + card frames → Presentation: 6→7
- Tooltips + damage previews + floating numbers → UX: 5→7
- Projected: 68-72/100

**Key insight from mentor:** 58/100 at alpha with 3 P0s is a reasonable starting point. The path from 58→75+ is mostly fixing existing issues, not building new things. Do not chase a score — chase a playable, polished core loop.

### Documentation Audit
**Date:** 2026-01-24
**Status:** Complete

**Done:**
- Full audit of all docs, PRs, context files, diaries against actual git/CI state
- Fixed .claude/CLAUDE.md: updated team current tasks (removed merged P0s), fixed branch naming convention per DEC-013, updated current state with accurate test count (809), lint status, open PR references
- Fixed SPRINT_BOARD.md: status "READY TO START" → "PHASE B IN PROGRESS", test count 778→809, branch names to flat convention, PR status for UX-02/JR-02
- Fixed README.md: test count 763→809+
- Fixed PROCESS.md: branch naming section aligned with DEC-013 (flat names, no sprint-N/ prefix)
- Fixed SPRINT_2_PLAN.md: branch workflow section aligned with DEC-013
- Fixed diaries: JR FIX-05 P0→P2, QA FIX-06 P0→P2
- Resolved 8 open decisions (DEC-004 through DEC-011) — all had clear majority approval

**Findings not fixed (for awareness):**
- 1 lint warning: unused `shuffleArray` in combatReducer.js (BE's file)
- 4 stale remote branches from Sprint 1 (claude/* branches) — can be pruned
- SL diary is blank (no sprint 2 tasks assigned, acceptable)
- TEAM_PLAN.md uses week-based timelines (legacy from mentor, acceptable as reference doc)
- DataEditor still in production bundle (51KB) — tracked as Sprint 3 PM-03

**Next:**
- Review and merge PRs #13 (UX-02) and #14 (JR-02)
- Kick off remaining Phase B tasks (BE-02, GD-02)
