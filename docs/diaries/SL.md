### Story Direction v2 APPROVED: "The Emergence"
**Date:** 2026-01-25
**Status:** APPROVED - Original direction after v1 rejection

**Context:**
- v1 was rejected by Stu as too derivative of Slay the Spire
- Created v2 with five fresh directions: Chrysalis, Surgery, Mouth, Garden, Echo
- Team reviewed, mentor approved the Hybrid (Chrysalis + Echo) = "The Emergence"

**Core Narrative: "The Emergence"**
- The Spire is a cocoon, not a prison - you're here to TRANSFORM
- Enemies are INGREDIENTS you absorb, not obstacles you destroy
- The Heart isn't evil - it's what you're BECOMING
- When you "win," you don't destroy - you MERGE and EMERGE
- The loop is process, not punishment - caterpillars don't transform on the first try

**Why This Is Original:**
- Reframes combat as consumption/absorption (maps to deck building!)
- Heart as aspiration, not enemy
- "Enemies as ingredients" is mechanically resonant
- Melancholy/hopeful, not grimdark
- No bargains, no cosmic horror tropes

**Boss Dialogue Samples (approved):**
- Slime Boss: "We are the beginning. Dissolution precedes construction."
- The Champ: "I loved the fighting too much to finish."
- Corrupt Heart: "You have consumed all that I was. Now consume what I am. BECOME."

**Mentor Guardrails:**
1. Emerged states stay undefined - ambiguity is the point
2. Maintain friction - not everyone wants to emerge
3. No preachiness - show, don't explain
4. Dark humor remains - not everything is ritual-solemn

**Implementation Priority:**
1. Boss dialogue document (full reframes)
2. Relic origin framework ("crystallized failures")
3. Event tone review
4. Card flavor text (later sprint)

**v1 archived as:** `docs/STORY_DIRECTION_V1_ARCHIVED.md`

**Satisfaction:** This pushed me creatively. The feedback was right - I'd played it safe with v1. The Emergence direction feels genuinely original while fitting the mechanics perfectly.

### Sprint 2 Complete
**Date:** 2026-01-24
**Status:** No sprint 2 tasks assigned. Sprint 1 work holding up fine.
**Summary:**
- SL-01 (events) and SL-02 (flavor text) from Sprint 1 remain validated and functional
- No regressions from Sprint 2 changes
**Satisfaction:** Happy with sprint 2. Events and flavor text working correctly.
**Ready for Sprint 3:** Yes. SL-03 (boss encounters & dialogue) queued for Phase 2.
