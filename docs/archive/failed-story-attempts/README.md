# Failed Story Attempts - Archive

**Date:** 2026-01-25
**Reason for Archive:** All three attempts rejected

## What Happened

SL (Story Line) created three narrative directions. All failed:

### v1: "The Endless Bargain" (STORY_DIRECTION_V1_ARCHIVED.md)
**Problem:** Too derivative of Slay the Spire
- Deal/bargain to enter the Spire
- Memory wipes between runs
- Heart dreams reality into existence
- Almost identical to StS implied lore

**Team Feedback:** "This is just Slay the Spire lore reorganized."

---

### v2: "The Emergence" (STORY_DIRECTION.md in this folder)
**Problem:** Tried to make combat into something else
- Spire as cocoon for transformation
- Enemies as "ingredients" you absorb
- Combat reframed as consumption/metamorphosis
- Heart as "what you're becoming"

**Team Feedback:** "Doesn't incorporate fighting, tries to go around it."

---

### v3: "The Arena" (STORY_DIRECTION_V3.md)
**Problem:** Shallow, preachy
- Warrior addicted to the only place they matter
- Outside world is "boring peace"
- Fighting for fighting's sake
- Loop as addiction/obsession

**Team Feedback:** "Rubbish."

## The Core Problem

All three asked the WRONG question:
- v1: "What deal did you make?"
- v2: "What are you transforming into?"
- v3: "Why do you love fighting?"

**The RIGHT question:** "What does deck-building FEEL like?"

## What Replaced Them

**Varrow's "The Endless War"** (now at `../../STORY_DIRECTION.md`)

Key insight: Deck-building feels like discovering who you are through constrained choices. You start generic, become specific through cards. That feeling IS the story.

- The Spire is an autonomous war that creates soldiers to perpetuate itself
- You're a construct/pattern, not a person who "entered"
- Your deck IS your identity - cards make you more specific, more REAL
- Death = dissolution (not real enough to persist)
- Relics = crystallized will from those who almost made it
- Heart = war's core algorithm

**Why it works:** Mechanically honest, embraces combat, not derivative, uses deck-building as the story itself.

## Lessons Learned

1. Don't impose meaning ON mechanics - derive meaning FROM them
2. Don't make combat into something else - embrace what the game IS
3. Ask what playing FEELS like, not what the lore "should be"
4. Safe creative work (v1) is derivative; clever creative work (v2) avoids the core; honest creative work (Varrow) faces it directly
