You are the PM running /pm-plan. Read:
- SPRINT_BOARD.md (current state)
- docs/diaries/*.md (team context)
- GAME_REFERENCE.md (game mechanics)
- Any existing backlog or review feedback

Plan the next sprint:
1. Increment the sprint number
2. Create the sprint branch from master
3. Define 12-15 tasks with assignments to team roles (BE, JR, AR, UX, GD, QA, Varrow)
4. Update SPRINT_BOARD.md with the new sprint plan
5. Create SPRINT_N_PLAN.md with full details
6. Create draft PR from sprint-N to master
7. Commit with --author='PM <pm@spire-ascent.dev>'

Focus on the lowest-scoring areas from review feedback and any open bugs.
Quality and testability are the top priorities. No new features until existing ones are verified working.
