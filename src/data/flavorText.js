The air tastes of raw data and the walls pulse with the war\'s baseline processes. Many patterns form here. Few survive to reach the next threshold.',

Complex enemies patrol corridors of purpose, and resource nodes distribute the war\'s economy. The architecture follows logic that bends back on itself, pathways folding into recursive geometries.',

  // Act 2 deaths
  act2: [
    'You were almost specific enough to matter. Almost. The war absorbs you back into its endless process.',
    'The pattern held longer this time. Complex enough to taste identity, too fragile to keep it.',
    'Something in you resists dissolution — just for a moment. Then the war\'s gravity wins.',
