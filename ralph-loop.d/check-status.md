Read docs/diaries/PM.md first — check for any URGENT/P0 entries.
Then read SPRINT_BOARD.md and git log --oneline -20.

Tell me:
1. What sprint are we on?
2. How many tasks remain?
3. Are all tasks merged?
4. Are there any BLOCKED tasks?

If ALL tasks in the current sprint are done, output exactly: SPRINT_COMPLETE
If there are tasks remaining, output exactly: SPRINT_ACTIVE
Output one of those two tags at the end of your response.
